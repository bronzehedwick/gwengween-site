      <section class="synopsis">
        <p><em>The Pulp Tales of Gwendolyn Gween, P.I.</em> is an episodic
          comedic podcast series in the vein of old radio dramas.</p>

        <p>It follows Gwen Gween, a junior P.I., as she takes on New York
          City's strangest cases, all while hunting for her long-lost parents
          and trying to survive as seemingly the only normal person in the
          universe.</p>

        <p>When she mysteriously receives her mother's bracelet, Gwen searches
          for answers with her best friend Vicky, her unhinged Uncle Ooley, and
          her alcoholic boss, the #2 P.I. in town, Dick Dirk.</p>

        <p>The only thing Gwen knows for certain is that someone&mdash;or,
          some<em>thing</em>&mdash;is looking for her, too.</p>

        <p class="sub-heading">Available now, detectives!</p>

          <h3>Gwendolyn Gween</h3>

          <p>
            An apprentice to the number 2 P.I. in New York, Dick Dirk, she's
            lived with, and taken care of, her Uncle Ooley since her parents
            died in a mysterious hot air balloon incident, 20 years ago.
          </p>

          <p>
            Haunted by the feeling that her parents are still alive, Gwen
            began her detective career with the secret hope of finding them
            some day. So when her mother's bracelet mysteriously appears in
            the mail, Gwen doesn't fall down a rabbit hole of suspicious male
            models, dangerous Nazi plots, and formless monsters who haunt her
            waking hours&mdash;no, she runs down it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gwendolyn is a fastidious workaholic, and a self proclaimed
            ‟soup connoisseur” who, in spite of the distractions and need
            to take on the weight of the world, simply wants her parents
            back.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="character vicky">

          {{ vicky }}

          <h3>Vicky Vance</h3>

          <p>
            A native Upper East Sider, who entered her cotillion to DMX's
            <em>Flesh Of My Flesh</em>. Vicky Vance plays by no one's rules,
            not even her own. As Gwen's self entitled ‟main bitch,” Vicky
            sees herself as Watson to Gwen's Batman (She knows that's not
            right, she just refuses to acknowledge it).
          </p>

          <p>
            Born to wealthy parents, Vicky has a very entitled view of the
            world, finding normal things like taxes, or the subway, or
            lobster not being with every meal, very strange.
          </p>

          <p>
            Somehow, she remains sincere: with her heart in the right
            place, Vicky sambas her way through life and into Gwen's
            adventures.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="character dick">

          {{ dick }}

          <h3>Dick Dirk</h3>

          <p>
            Proudly the number 2 P.I. in town, Dick Dirk is an immensely
            ill-prioritized person, but a surprisingly functional alcoholic.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was once said that Dick is
            as gifted in the art of detection as he is in inflating his own
            ego. Of course it was Dick himself who proudly said this, but
            everyone agreed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Completely dedicated to his work, Dick lives alone and has no
            family, but in his moments of drunken clarity, considers his
            young apprentice Gwen like a spunky sister, although he would
            never admit this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aloof and rude, Dick Dirk has a certain
            charm only afforded to a fun loving drunk.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="character hector">

          {{ hector }}

          <h3>Hector ‟The Schvantz” Savala</h3>

          <p>
            Both strikingly handsome and packing a schvantz that even your
            grandmother would write home about, Hector Savala is hired to
            steal Gwen's bracelet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, with his task in mind, the one time male model soon falls in
            love with Gwen. Sharing a similar history of parental absence with
            Gwen, Hector gets close to her for the sake of his mission, but
            more importantly, his personal growing interest.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, he has the IQ of a raisin.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="character ooley">

          {{ ooley }}

          <h3>Uncle Ooley</h3>

          <p> Gwen's uncle and an eccentric who may be the only person in
            history to retire off a ‟get moderately well off quick” scheme.
            With no real responsibilities in mind, Uncle Ooley, as he calls
            himself, seeks adventure, intrigue, and weird romance.

          <p> After pining for the woman his brother married, and then
            raising Gwen by having her raise him, Uncle Ooley feels
            particularly protective over his niece. </p>

          <p> Following Gwen on big cases and creating weapons of
            hijinks-like destruction, Ooley marches to the beat of a drum no
            one knows exists, but he does it as sincerely and loudly as
            possible. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="character tic-tac-man">
          <h3>Tic Tac Man</h3>

          <p>
            A barely finished sentient experiment made of bio-engineered
            material, created by Waggle's best scientists, including Darnell
            and B.B. Gween, Gwen's parents.
          </p>

          <p>
            After Waggle's labs were shutdown and the Gween's disappeared,
            the Tic Tac Man began searching for answers, building itself with
            parts of humans, leaving a trail of dead bodies in it's wake, and
            that strange rattle that is it's namesake.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly, the Tic Tac Man began searching for the
            bracelet. It knows what it really is. It knows what it could
            really do. It knows Gwen.
          </p>
